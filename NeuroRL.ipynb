    "Classical conditioning is where a neutral stimulus -- also called the _unconditioned stimulus, US_ -- is paired with a response-producing stimulus -- _the conditioned stimulus, CS_. After the association is learned, the neutral stimulus *alone* can produce the response.\n",
    "\n",
    "The most famous example is Pavlov's dogs: Pavlov rang a bell before feeding his dogs which would cause them to salivate. After a while, the dogs would start salivating when they heard the bell, even if no food was presented.\n",
    "\n",
    "In 1972 Rescorla and Wagner proposed a simple model to explain this learning process. The model is based on the idea that the strength of the association between the CS and US is proportional to the discrepancy between the expected and actual US.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **1.1. Model (maths)**\n",
    "Following on from the Pavlov's dogs example, suppose the bell 🔔 is the conditioned stimulus and the food 🦴 is the unconditioned stimulus with a response (reward) of strength $R$. The _value_ of the unconditioned stimulus, $\\hat{V}$, is the strength of the association between the  stimulus and the unconditioned response, $R$. In other words, $\\hat{V}$ is a _prediction_ of how much reward I think I'll get when I see the unconditioned stimulus. \n",

    "Mathematically, the model is defined as following simple equation:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\hat{V} \\leftarrow \\hat{V} + \\alpha \\cdot \\underbrace{(R - \\hat{V})}_{\\delta = \\textrm{``error\"}}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "I.e. the increment in the value of the stimulus is proportional to the discrepancy between the reward (the unconditioned response) that was recieved, $R$, and the reward that was predicted from the stimulus, $\\hat{V}$. The proportionality constant $\\alpha$ is the learning rate.\n",
    "\n",
    "> 📝 **Exercise 1.1** \n",
    "> 1. Consider a simple example where there is only one stimulus with zero initial value. A constant reward, $R$ is given each trial. Show the value of the stimulus after the first trial is given by $V(1) = \\alpha  \\cdot R$.\n",
