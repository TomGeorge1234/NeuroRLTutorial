    "Another change we'll make is that instead of passing the state directly into the Q-function as we did before, we'll pass a _feature vector_ of the state. \n",

    "\n",
    "There are a number of benefits to this:\n",
    "1. **Generalisation**: The function can generalise to unseen states which are similar to states it has seen before. This is because is if $\\mathbf{\\phi}(\\mathbf{x})$ is close to $\\mathbf{\\phi}(\\mathbf{x}^{\\prime})$ then $\\hat{Q}_{\\theta}(\\mathbf{x})$ will be close to $\\hat{Q}_{\\theta}(\\mathbf{x}^{\\prime})$. _Before_, if a state was unseen the agent would have no idea what to do.\n",
    "2. **Biological plausibility**: The brain is thought to represent states using feature vectors. Famous examples in the navigation domain include: \n",
    "    - **Place cells** in the hippocampus fire when an animal is in a particular location.\n",
    "    - **Grid cells** in the entorhinal cortex fire in a hexagonal grid pattern across the environment.\n",
    "    - **Boundary Vector Cells** in thesubiculum fire when an animal is near a boundary / wall. \n",
    "    - **Head direction cells** in the thalamus fire when an animal is facing a particular direction.\n",
    "3. **Dimensionality reduction**: The feature vector can be much smaller than the state space. For example, in a grid world with 1000000 \"states\", a well-designed feature vector might only have have 100 features.\n",
    "4. **Feature engineering**: We can design the feature vector to encode, _a priori_, domain knowledge about the environment. For example: \n",
    "    - In a RL task where the inputs are words, we should encode the words as word embeddings (aka. feature vectors). It would be sensible to encode similar words as similar vectors for example \"cat\" and \"feline\" should be close in the feature space. Anything we then learn about \"cat\" should quickly generalise to \"feline\".\n",
    "    - In the grid world we might use states features which are continuous in space (e.g. smooth place cells). That way if we learn that position $(x,y)$ is good we can quickly generalise to $(x+\\delta_x, y+\\delta_y)$.\n",
