On the next trial the value of state 8 will be updated due to the a TD error because the new value of upcoming state 9 wasn't predicted. Thus, the bump moves backwards at approximately a rate of one-step-each-episode. This makes because each state bootstraps from the next state's value.

    "1. A good example might be moving to a new neighbourhood which you don't know well. You must decide whether to exploit what you already know (e.g. go to the same restaurant you always go to) or explore new options (try a new restaurant, which, given your lack of knowledge, might be better or worse than your usual choice). Another example might be the Netflix recommendation algorithm which must balance showing you things you already like (exploitation) with showing you new things you might like (exploration).\n",
    "2. In a stable environment that is well-understood and not subject to change, it is probably better to prioritize exploitation. An example of such an environment is a manufacturing assembly line with consistent demand for a specific product. In this case, it is best to exploit what you know works to maximize efficiency and output, rather than exploring new methods that may be less efficient or break the system.\n",
    "3. In an unstable and constantly changing environment that is not well understood, it is better to prioritize exploration. An example of such an environment is the early stages of a startup in a rapidly evolving technology sector. In this case, it is important to explore new ideas and methods to adapt to the changing landscape and find the best path forward. Another example might be starting a new job: it's worth exploring different ways of working, different projects and different collaborators to find the best fit.\n",
    "4. Many real world scenarios _stochastic_ policies are optimal. One example is bluffing in poker. If you always  bluff when you have a poor hand your opponents will quickly learn this and exploit you by betting against you. If you never bluff then your opponents will always fold when you have a good hand and you will never win much money. However, if you bluff randomly (stochastically) then your opponents will be unable to predict your behaviour and will be forced to play more cautiously. Rock-Paper-Scissor is a similar. Another example is the behaviour of animals in the wild: if a predator always follows the same path it will be easy for its prey to avoid it. However, if it follows a stochastic path then it will be more likely to catch its prey. \n",
    "5. Softmax action selection is a popular alternative to $\\epsilon$-greedy. In softmax action selection, the probability of selecting an action is proportional to the exponentiated value of the Q-value for that action. This allows for a smooth transition between exploration and exploitation, with the probability of selecting the best action increasing as the Q-values become more certain.\n",
    "$$ P(A_t = a | S_t = s) = \\frac{e^{Q(s, a) / \\tau}}{\\sum_{a'} e^{Q(s, a') / \\tau}} $$\n",
    "where $\\tau$ is a temperature parameter that controls the degree of exploration. When $\\tau$ is high, the policy is close to uniform random action selection, and as $\\tau$ approaches zero, the policy becomes deterministic and selects the action with the highest Q-value."
