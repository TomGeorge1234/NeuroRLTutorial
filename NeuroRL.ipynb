    "Classical conditioning is where a neutral stimulus (the unconditioned stimulus) is paired with a response-producing stimulus (the conditioned stimulus). After the association is learned, the neutral stimulus *alone* can produce the response.\n",
    " \n",
    "The most famous example is Pavlov's dogs: Pavlov rang a bell before feeding his dogs which would cause them to salivate. After a while, the dogs would start salivating when they heard the bell, even if no food was presented.\n",
    "\n",
    "In 1972 Rescorla and Wagner proposed a simple model to explain this learning process. The model is based on the idea that the strength of the association between the CS and US is proportional to the discrepancy between the expected and actual US.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **1.1. Model (maths)**\n",
    "Following on from the Pavlov's dogs example, suppose the bell 🔔 is the conditioned stimulus, $S$, and the food 🦴 is the unconditioned stimulus with a response (reward) of strength $R$. The bell is paired with the food allowing an association to be learned. We notate this as follows: \n",
    "$$ S \\rightarrow R $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Under the Rescorla-Wagner model, the goal is to learn the _value_ of the unconditioned stimulus:\n",

    "\n",
    "(Note: this slightly excessive notation now will come in useful later). We can \"learn\" this association by updating $\\hat{V}(S)$ (our current _estimate_ of the value of the stimulus) based on the following trivial learning rule: \n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\hat{V} \\leftarrow \\hat{V} + \\alpha \\cdot \\underbrace{(R - \\hat{V})}_{\\delta = \\textrm{``error\"}}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This is Rescorla-Wagner. I.e. the increment in the value of the stimulus is proportional to the discrepancy between the reward (the unconditioned response) that was recieved, $R$, and the reward that was predicted from the stimulus, $\\hat{V}$. The proportionality constant $\\alpha$ is the learning rate.\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\delta$ is the _prediction error_ and is the key concept in reinforcement learning. It is the discrepancy between what was expected and what was recieved. \n",
    "- Positive $\\delta$ means the reward was better than expected, so the value of the stimulus should be increased.\n",
