In this tutorial we'll study and build reinforcement learning models inspired by the brain. By the end you'll understand, and be able to construct, a series of simple but surpringly powerful model of how agents learn to navigate in environment and find rewards.

Note: the colab renders better in Safari and Firefox than Chrome.
